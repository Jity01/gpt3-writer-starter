        <p>reinforce is a <span style={{ fontSize: "larger", "fontWeight": "bold", textDecoration: "underline" }}>mini journal</span> meant to be a home for all of the little insights that you have throughout the day.</p>
        <p>the hope is to make you feel more connected to your values, and with those connections, to help you <span style={{ fontSize: "larger", "fontWeight": "bold", textDecoration: "underline" }}>solve your problems</span> more effectively.</p>

        <h3>&emsp;here&apos;s how it works:</h3>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>when you have an insightful thought you&apos;d like to record, hit the &quot;log&quot; button to save it as a new journal entry</li>
        <p style={{ color: "hsl(174, 69%, 40%)"}}>ðŸ’¡tip: as you&apos;re logging, hit &quot;return&quot; three times to get questions that&apos;ll help you reflect better</p>
        <br />
        <Example>
          <p>&quot;michael said a lot of ideas that you have might actually be really stupid - ineffective AND distracting. that might be something you wanna consider before attaching yourself too heavily to any one of them.&quot;</p>
        </Example>
        <br />
        <li>whenever you have problems, hit the glowing blue button to turn on search mode - this allows you to search through your thoughts to get assistance from your past writings</li>
        <p style={{ color: "hsl(174, 69%, 40%)"}}>ðŸ’¡tip: as you&apos;re searching, hit &quot;return&quot; three times to get questions that&apos;ll help you express your emotions better</p>
        <br />
        <Example>
          <p>i searched about being unusually distracted and this was one of the logs that came up - funny but effective!</p>
          <p>you have to stop playing with your hair when you&apos;re thinking bro it&apos;s so distracting. i&apos;m writing this down because i am +begging+ you to stop. i&apos;m so done with this.</p>
